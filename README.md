# Data-Science-Assessment

This repository contains resources and code for a data science assessment project. It includes dataset(s), exploratory data analysis (EDA), model experimentation, and final model artifacts.

## Contents

- **Assessment-2-Associate-DS(in).csv**  
  Primary dataset for the assessment.

- **DataScienceAssessment_EDA_and_Model_choice_experimentation.ipynb**  
  Jupyter notebook that covers:
  - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
  - Feature Engineering
  - Model Selection and Experimentation
  - Results and Insights

- **best_lgbm_model.pkl**  
  Serialized LightGBM model (Pickle format) representing the best performing model from experimentation.

- **lgbm_global_forecaster.joblib**  
  Joblib-serialized LightGBM forecaster model for efficient deployment or inference.

## Usage
2. Open the Jupyter notebook or click the open Colab option(`DataScienceAssessment_EDA_and_Model_choice_experimentation.ipynb`) to review the data analysis and model development process. Just select run all to correctly generate res

3. Use the provided model files (`best_lgbm_model.pkl` or `lgbm_global_forecaster.joblib`) for making predictions as needed.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- LightGBM
- Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, and other standard data science libraries
